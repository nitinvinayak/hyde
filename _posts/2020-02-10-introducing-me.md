Hi! Iâ€™m Nitin, final year undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) with a keen interest in deep learning and data science.

I truly believe that most of the problems that the humanity is facing today can be solved through Data.

Currently I am an entry-level data science intern who takes pride in building models that translate data points into business insights.
