---

Hi! Iâ€™m Nitin, final year undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) with a keen interest in deep learning and data science.</br>
I truly believe that most of the problems that the humanity is facing today can be solved through Data.</br>
Currently I am a entry-level data science intern who takes pride in building models that translate data points into business insights. Eager to apply the same knowledge to real-world business problems.
