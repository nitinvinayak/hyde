Hi! Iâ€™m Nitin, Final Year Student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) with a keen interest in deep learning and data science.
I truly believe that the most pressing issues that the humanity is facing today can be solved through Data.
Currently I am a entry-level data science intern who takes pride in building models that translate data points into business insights. Eager to apply the same knowledge to real-world business problems.
